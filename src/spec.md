# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a darshan.ac.in-inspired college marketing website with entirely new branding, updated contact/address details, and a distinct non-blue/non-purple theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a clone-style site structure (Home, About, Academics/Departments, Admissions, Placements, News/Events, Contact) with working navigation/routes and responsive layouts.
- Replace all branding with a new institution name and consistent site title across header, footer, and page metadata (no “Darshan” references).
- Centralize contact details and address into a single frontend configuration object and render those values wherever needed (footer and contact page/section included).
- Apply a fresh, coherent visual theme (distinct color palette avoiding blue/purple, typography, buttons, spacing, and accessible interactive states) consistently across pages/components.
- Add structured frontend data files for repeatable content (e.g., departments and events) and render sections from that data.
- Add original generated static assets (logo/wordmark and hero/banner) under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and use them in the header/footer and homepage hero.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a fully branded, responsive college website with the expected sections, consistent theming, updated contact info everywhere, and homepage/header visuals using new original assets.
