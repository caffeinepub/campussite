  "summary": "Diff adds a React hash-routed marketing site skeleton with header/footer, multiple pages, warm amber theme variables, and structured content data for departments/events. However, evidence is missing for required generated static assets being present in public, browser metadata/title updates, centralized site/contact configuration definition, and the required icon sprite asset usage.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Browser tab title and visible branding must match the new institution name consistently across header, footer, and metadata; remove any Darshan references; do not hot-link darshan.ac.in assets.",
      "reason": "Header/footer appear to use a new name via siteConfig, but there is no evidence of metadata/browser tab title updates (e.g., index.html/head management) in the diff summary.",

      "reason": "Components reference a centralized config (siteConfig), but the actual configuration object/file contents are not shown/added in the diff summary, and the footer contact section is truncated so it cannot be verified that all contact details are sourced from config.",

      "reason": "Code references the wordmark and hero image paths, but the diff summary does not show any files added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and there is no evidence of the required monochrome icon sprite being added or used.",
